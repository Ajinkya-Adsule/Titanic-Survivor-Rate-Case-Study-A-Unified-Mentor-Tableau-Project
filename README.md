Hi Freinds ,

I Have completed an case study for survival rate for all passengers across all class of passenger ,First class , second class and third class , all the survivor are also seperated on the basis of gender , this data is converted into an pie chart in Tableau Public in order to visualise this data easily . 

The Titanic's maiden voyage carried approximately 2,208 people, including passengers and crew. Of these, roughly 1,496 perished in the sinking. The ship's capacity was 3,320, but it was not fully occupied on its fateful voyage.

*Key Facts*:
Total on board: Around 2,208 passengers and crew.
Passenger capacity: 2,453.
Casualties: Approximately 1,496 deaths.
Lifeboat capacity: The 20 lifeboats could only hold 1,178 people, not enough for everyone

Hence I created an Tableau Dashboard which you can interact with on Tableau Public BY clicking the link Below .

**Here an detailed Conclusion for your reference.**

In general, women and children had significantly higher survival rates on the Titanic than men. Specifically, women and children were more likely to survive than men, regardless of their class. However, survival rates varied within each class, with higher survival rates for first-class passengers compared to second and third-class passengers. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Women:
First Class: Approximately 97% of first-class female passengers survived.
Second Class: Around 92% of second-class female passengers survived.
Third Class: Around 50% of third-class female passengers survived. 
Men:
First Class: Approximately 37% of first-class male passengers survived.
Second Class: Around 16% of second-class male passengers survived.
Third Class: Around 14% of third-class male passengers survived. 
Children:
Children, regardless of class, generally had higher survival rates than men. 
Overall:
Women had a much higher chance of survival than men, regardless of their class. 
First-class passengers had the highest survival rate overall, followed by second and third-class passengers. 
The "women and children first" policy played a significant role in the survival of women and children.
